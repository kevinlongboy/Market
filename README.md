##  ✅ Let's Go Shopping
  
Welcome to Market, your one-stop shop for everything you need.

Inspired by <a href="https://www.target.com/" alt="Target website">AirBnB</a>, Market gives shoppers the ability to browse products, view past orders, read reviews, and checkout.

<br>
<br>

##  ✅ Guest Services

### Cart

_The main feature of Market_

As a Host, users are able to list their home on the site and highlight its best qualities in the listing. Hosts should give a brief description of their home, henceforth known as a "Spot", then choose a befitting rate for a nightly stay.

As a Guest, users are able to peruse through CraneBnB to find the perfect place for their stay in Seattle.

<br>

### Reviews

_Hear the people's voice_

CraneBnB gives its members the ability to voice their opinions and share their experiences from previous stays.

Users can also delete any reviews they've previously posted, if they so choose.
