    description: "These mini gingerbread houses are so cute!! Perfect size for my 2, 4, and 6 yo kids. Just enough to decorate and they each get their own to work on. We used a dremel to separate the pieces and then hot glued the pieces to assemble the houses. I gave it 4 stars because I can‚Äôt imagine breaking all the pieces apart and not everyone has the tools to make it easier.",
